## Overview + Scope

This repository is part of a 3 part crash course on rewriting Git history. It is intended to be used in conjunction with ONS' guidance on rewriting Git history if a sensitive file has been committed to a repository. The purpose of this repository is to test the steps outlined in the guidance, and to provide a practical example of how to rewrite Git history.

The process outlined within the guidance is available within each scenario repository. See [this flowchart](./process_flowchart.png) for an overview of the process.

## Other Scenarios

- [Scenario 1: Last commit contains the secret by itself](https://github.com/ONS-Innovation/git-history-crash-course-a)
- [Scenario 2: Last commit contains the secret with other changes](https://github.com/ONS-Innovation/git-history-crash-course-b)
- [Scenario 3: A previous commit contains the secret](https://github.com/ONS-Innovation/git-history-crash-course-c)

## How to use this repository

1. Create a fork of this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Read [the scenario](#the-scenario) below.
4. Follow the process outlined in the [guidance flowchart](./process_flowchart.png) to rewrite the Git history.
5. Once you have completed the process, push your changes to your fork.
6. Check that the sensitive file is no longer present in the Git history.

This should be done using only the steps outlined in the guidance, and not using any other tools or methods.

## The Scenario

This repository contains a simple Python script which imports from a `.env` file. The `.env` file contains a secret which should not be committed to the repository.

The last commit contains the secret alongside other code changes, and the goal is to remove it from the Git history while preserving the other changes made in that commit.
